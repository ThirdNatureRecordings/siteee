      <a onclick="alert('A r i e s ~ I will give a voice to what has been waiting in the wings to be seen and heard. There are parts of me that I may not understand yet and this excites me. Like any good story there is character development. May I trust that parts of my life can be curated specially for my own growth. The roots of any conflict dissipate as I allow for other perspectives and contemplations to enhance my story. Certain emotions may come up that I don’t know what to do with. This is okay, because I am curious to explore new territories. Here’s to me, taking the key and unlocking a door never before opened.')">aries</a>
      <a onclick="alert('T a u r u s ~ I let go of the connections that make me feel strained and squished. Relationships that have some growing room are what I need to see myself clearly. They help me to witness where I have put up blockades around love in an effort to try and control it. I’ve cultivated something deep with myself and when I join forces with what and who I choose, we are in a good position to spread joy beyond the collaboration. The world needs this right now and maybe I do too. I don’t wish to be perfect at this time, nor do I wish for anyone else to be. I’m learning and I ask for the exchanges that encourage compassion from the heart and putting my own creative spin on things.')">taurus</a>
      <a onclick="alert('G e m i n i ~ This Sagittarius Season I will reconnect with the ‘why’ in what I do. The last while has been fast paced, disorienting at times and I can empathize with why I want to skip to the next part already. The part where my eyes don’t feel glazed anymore as my body adjusts to change. But there is so much I learn through self-effort and the experience of seeing myself through this. There has been an exceptional amount of things I’ve had to juggle, but I owe it to myself to meet myself where I am at. This season may I realize that my thoughts are meant to be bonds, not binds. I see the clouds parting for me and the Sun on my skin re-instills a sense of hope.')">gemini</a>
      <a onclick="alert('C a n c e r ~ I have everything I need to finish what I started. In fact, I witness and pay respect to how I naturally find a way to build with the materials I have. I ground down into being process oriented right now rather than results oriented. This allows for my creativity to come out and play while releasing the tension in my body that I need to let go of. There isn’t anything wrong with wanting to be seen. The world wants to get to know me too. What I am doing is enough, I understand that confidence in my output helps me see the closure available in each moment. May I be present in my actions and efforts and reassess my boundaries about how much I take on.')">cancer</a>
      <a onclick="alert('L e o ~ This season I will recognize the challenges of my past that have enriched and strengthened me. For there are certain experiences that have added fuel to my fire and resources to my toolkit. I will have markers for myself so that I can understand when I’m feeling burnt out. When I need a break. It’s okay to wish for emotional health and stability. I work steadily, thoughtfully and compassionately. Especially towards myself. I will ask for what I need and deserve. There are so many subtleties experienced at once. This momentum is all the permission I need to explore the expression of who I am in all of my value, lovability and resourcefulness.')">leo</a>

      <a onclick="alert('L i b r a ~ May I give more awareness to what double takes my attention. The trial and error periods of the last months have helped me invite in ways to work smarter and direct my energy in healthy currents. I will nurture this momentum by consistently checking in. Posing the question “what is it that I can do right now” eases any emotional wounds around what it means to try. I will honour the moments to take a step back to see if I can fill all of my cups from one overflowing well. Reassessment doesn’t mean failure. Reassessment brings movement to how I see things and allows for the opportunity to see the next step before I make my next move.')">libra</a>
      <a onclick="alert('S c o r p i o ~ I invite in reality checks around where my energy/thoughts have been going. My body will tell me when too much focus has me feeling dry, parched and unsure. May I not be frightened by this, instead welcome in an opportunity to adapt. It’s a vulnerable position to think for myself and still desire relating to others. But I want to. I’m beginning to see the certain magic I bring to my relationships. What makes them strong and enduring. Connection is meant to uplift my spirits. May I invite in the people and places that feel like home. When I feel comfortable, I can mindfully and intricately create the world around me.')">scorpio</a>
      <a onclick="alert('S a g i t t a r i u s ~ May I be motivated to do and go forth, affirming the ideas I believe in. This isn’t the beginning for me, more so a reflection of where I have been and a recognition of all the change I have gone through. I realize that the things I hope for at this time require a certain diligence from me. May I soften into what feels like it is worth my time and energy. With so much shifting around me I commit to actions that remind me of the strongest parts of myself. It’s my season and may I adorn myself in any way I see fit. Whether that be through outfits, scents, giggles, etc. I am enchanting, mystic, and metamorphosing.')">sagittarius</a>
      <a onclick="alert('C a p r i c o r n ~ I take full responsibility for my choices and ask for help in fulfilling my commitments when I need to. I notice when things feel heavy but this doesn’t mean they have to weigh me down. Perhaps the pressure crystalizes me into the diamond that I am becoming. May I laugh a little lighter and focus on what I can control. Every so often we get to enjoy moments of feeling complete and that is so, so, sweet. It may not be fully in my awareness of what has shifted, but something has and it is altering my reality for the better. This season I will communicate how I see the world. My visions are valued.')">capricorn</a>
      <a onclick="alert('A q u a r i u s ~ It’s my time to commit to the people, places, and things that feel like a breath of fresh air. I trust my boundaries and those expressed to me as the container for expression between myself and everything else. Reconnection helps to warm up any icy feelings, so let’s get that fire burning. I settle into life’s pleasures in whatever way feels good to me now. When I leave doubt at the door, I can live from an honest place. No strings attached, I arrive with presence and this allows me to give freely and from the heart. In turn, this act heals me too. This season is meant to serve as a burst of new life, putting that spark back.')">aquarius</a>
      <a onclick="alert('P i s c e s ~ It’s up to me to see that the compassion I give myself is closely related to the compassion I give to others. It is in relationships that we heal the most, so may my connection with those I care for revive the parts of me that I may have forgotten. This might bring up a lot of what I have repressed, but I trust that I will allow for the space to accept where I am at. Life may be strange and bizarre as the world shifts, and I let go from this obscure tug of war. It is in this that I understand that I am not meant to suffer. I am Pisces and I will do my best to openly enjoy life’s pleasure’s even if I have experienced restrictions in the past/present.')">pisces</a>
